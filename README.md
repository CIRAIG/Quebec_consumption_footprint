This project describes the estimation quebecers' consumption's footprint. To do this it builds on the global MultiRegional Input Output table EXIOBASE3 
and the consumption data from "Institut de la statistique Qu√©bec" (https://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/statistiques/conditions-vie-societe/depenses-avoirs-dettes/depenses/index.html).

It contains three notebooks:
- technology_matrix.ipynb describes the extrapolation of the Canadian sectors of EXIOBASE3 into Quebec sectors
- final_demand.ipynb describes the formatting of the final_demand by Quebec households
- footprint_Quebec.ipynb calculates the associated footprint

Start with the technology_matrix.ipynb notebook.
